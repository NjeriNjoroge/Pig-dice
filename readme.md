### Description of Project
The Pig Dice game is a very simple dice game in which two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls. At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced
with two decisions:

**roll** - If the player rolls a
1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.
2 - 6: the number is added to the player's total and the player's turn continues.

**hold** - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.
